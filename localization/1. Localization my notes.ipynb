    "## Localization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will understand the concept of localization. These notes are prepared while I took the [cs373](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-for-robotics--cs373) course on Udacity\n",

    "Informal definition of Localization is about knowing where the Robot/Autonomous vehicle is in the given terrain/map accurately. GPS has a way to tell us where we are, however, the accuracy if off by meters most of the times. For autonomous vehicles knowing the location to centimeter accuracy is crucial to stay within the lanes (in case of self driving cars) even if no markings are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets take a brief look at what exactly is the localization and what math is involved in it. We will look at the same diagrams as the ones in the lecture.\n",

    "1. Assume that we have a map in one dimension (we can move right or left) and the robot has no clue where it is at the moment. The probability at this point is same for each location in the map. That is, the probability of Robot being present at a location is uniformly distributed over the entire map region and the probability distribution would look like the following.\n",

    "![prior](Prior.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assume the map has three doors and the robot can detect a door and non door area in front of it. Given that the robot senses there is a door in front of it (which can have an error in detection), the probability distribution of the robot's location changes to the following\n",
    "\n",
    "![posterior](Posterior.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Notice how we have three peaks in front of the doors. At this stage the probability of the robot being in front of these three doors is same. Since we have errors in the sensors, there is a small residual probability in other regions as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The robot can move in the right or left direction and assuming it knows where it moves, the probability distribution for the robot's current location shifts as the robot moves as we see below\n",

    "![posterior3](Posterior3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the posterior of the previous state becomes the prior for this new state. Thus as and how the robot moves and sees/senses new information and **given that the map is available with the robot**, the robot can continue to accurately detect its current location.\n",

    "- Now given the fact the robot sees red, lets compute the probability the robot is standing in front of a given cell in the grid\n"
